The ARL OpenSHMEM for Epiphany package may be extracted to any location. The
./src directory contains all of the OpenSHMEM routines and other supplemental
routines. Separate files for each routine are required to reduce the total
binary size when compiling with the library. You may install the shmem.h header
and libshmem.a library wherever you like. The test codes within the ./test
directory will use the relative path to the header and library during
compilation.

To build the library, first unpack the archive:

cd src
make

Then test and benchmark the code (optional):

cd ../test
make
./run_tests.sh
